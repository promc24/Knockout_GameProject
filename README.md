# Knockout_GameProject
Knockout is a old-school tyle fighting game prototype implemented in C++ with the aid of SFML for graphics and audio. The user will be controlling the mage player and the program will be handling the swordsman player. For both players, the controls for movement are the up, down, right, left arrow keys. The attacks can be categorized as basic and ultimate and each player also has a defense mode. The controls for the above are W- Basic attack, A- Ultimate attack, and D- Defence mode. The ultimate for the mage is a shooting blaster and the ultimate for the swordsman is a teleport strike. Hint: Run away from the swordsman when he is doing his ultimate attack as he will teleport to your position and the damage of the hit will be critical.
